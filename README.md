A simple to-do list app with built-in Pomodoro timer functionality. This project was created using SwiftUI and CoreData.

ToDoPomodoros is a productivity app built in SwiftUI that utilizes the Pomodoro technique to help users manage their tasks and improve their focus.
  
# Usage

  
To add a task, click the "+" button in the top right corner of the main screen and enter the task title and the number of Pomodoros needed to complete it.

To start the Pomodoro timer for a task, click on the task in the list and click the "Start" button. The timer will count down from 25 minutes. (It is now just 10 seconds for easy test)

To mark a task as completed, simply complete all of the required Pomodoros. The task will be marked as grayed in the list.

 
# Features

  
- Users can create and delete tasks, with number of pomodoros for each task (25-minute work sessions) required to complete it.
- Users can track their progress on each task as they complete Pomodoros.
- The app provides motivational advice to help users stay focused.
- When all Pomodoros for a task are completed, the task is grayed and "Start" button is disabled.
- User can undo a session if he thinks the session wasn't so productive.
